# coloredtime
This is a widget for Übersicht https://github.com/felixhageloh/uebersicht

This widget replicates James E. Murphy’s awesome site http://whatcolourisit.scn9a.org/, which displays the time and the color that is created when you interpret the time as a hex color.

For example, if it is 5:53:16 PM, the color of your desktop would be #175316, which is a dark green.
